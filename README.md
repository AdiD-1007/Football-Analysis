# ⚽ FIFA 21 Player Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is a simple yet insightful data analysis project based on the FIFA 21 player dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, understand the attributes of football players, identify patterns, and visualize interesting insights — all using Python.


## 📌 About the Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** `players_21.csv`
- **Source:** [Kaggle - FIFA 21 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset)
- The dataset includes information on over 18,000 players such as age, nationality, club, skill attributes, wages, and more.


## 🔍 Objectives of the Project

- Analyze player distribution by age, nationality, and position.
- Identify top-rated players based on overall ratings.
- Explore the relationships between key player attributes.
- Visualize player wages, values, and other trends.
- Export all visualizations in a clean PDF report.


## 📊 Key Visualizations Included

- Bar chart of top 10 players by overall rating.
- Histogram of player age distribution.
- Top 10 countries by number of players.
- Correlation heatmap of major player attributes.
- Most common player positions.
- Wage distribution of top 100 rated players.


## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations
- Plotly (optional) for interactive charts
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- PDF export using `matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf`
